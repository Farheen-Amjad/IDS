Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that involves the use of statistical and computational techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data. It involves a combination of skills from various fields, including statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific expertise.

In recent years, the field of data science has grown rapidly, with businesses and organizations of all sizes realizing the importance of data-driven decision-making. Data scientists are in high demand, and the field offers excellent career opportunities.

# Key Concepts in Data Science
Data Collection: Data collection involves acquiring data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, and sensors.

#### Data Cleaning: 
Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing data in the dataset.

#### Data Exploration: 
Data exploration involves examining the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.

#### Data Analysis: 
Data analysis involves applying statistical and computational techniques to draw insights from the data.

#### Data Visualization: 
Data visualization involves presenting data in graphical or visual form to help communicate insights and patterns.

#### Machine Learning: 
Machine learning involves using algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in data to make predictions or decisions.

# Types of Data

#### Big Data: 
No precise or universal definition can be given to Big Data ... Massive datasets, or data that contains greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity (3V rule).

#### Structured Data: 
Data that has predefined structures which are already stored in relational databases or spreadsheets in an ordered manner (traditional row-column databases). There are two sources of structured data:

Machine-generated: All the data received from sensors, weblogs, and financial systems including medical devices, GPS data, data of usage statistics captured by servers.
Human-generated: Mainly includes all the data that humans input into computers such as names and other personal details, websites visited, types of movies watched (this can be used by companies to figure out their customer behavior and make the appropriate business decision, for example, the recommendations system of Netflix, Youtube or Medium)

#### Unstructured Data: 
Data with no predefined structure, comes in any size or form (they have no clear format in storage), cannot be easily stored in tables. It is also classified based on its source:

Machine-generated: accounts for all the satellite images, security cameras, radar data captures and many more besides.
Human-generated: is found in abundance across the internet since it includes social media data, mobile data, email, and website content. This means that the pictures we upload to Facebook or Instagram handle, the videos we watch on Youtube and even text messages we send.

#### Semi-Structured Data: 
The line between unstructured data and semi-structured data has always been unclear since most of the semi-structured data appear to be unstructured at a glance. Information that is not in the traditional database format as structured data, but contains some organizational properties which make it easier to process. For example, NoSQL documents are considered to be semi-structured, since they contain keywords that can be used to process the document easily.

# Tools and Technologies in Data Science
Programming Languages: Python and R are the most commonly used programming languages in data science.

#### Data Analysis Libraries: 
Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy are popular data analysis libraries in Python.

#### Visualization Tools: 
Matplotlib and Seaborn are commonly used data visualization libraries in Python.

#### Machine Learning Libraries: 
Scikit-learn and TensorFlow are popular machine learning libraries in Python.

#### Data Storage and Management: 
SQL is the most commonly used language for managing and querying relational databases. NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra are used for managing unstructured data.

These are just some of the common data types and sequences in Python. Python also supports many other data types and sequences, including **bytearrays, frozensets**, and **namedtuples.**

# READIND COMMA SEPERATED VALUES (CSV) FILES IN PYHTON

In Python, you can read and write CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files using the built-in csv module. **Example** of how to read and write CSV files in Python:

**Reading CSV Files:**

In Python, you can read and write CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files using the built-in csv module. **Example** of how to read and write CSV files in Python:

**CODE**

<a name="_hlk132369216"></a>**Print(Farheen Amjad)**

import csv

with open('file.csv') as csv\_file:

`    `csv\_reader = csv.reader(csv\_file)

`    `for row in csv\_reader:

`     `print(row)

**Explaination:** 

In this example, we open a CSV file called 'file.csv' using the open() function and read its contents using the csv.reader() function. We then iterate through each row in the CSV file using a for loop and print each row to the console.


**WRITING COMMA SEPERATED VALUES (CSV) FILES**

**CODE**

**Print(Farheen)**

import csv

data = [['Name', 'Age', 'Gender'], ['John', 25, 'Male'], ['Jane', 30, 'Female']]

with open('new\_file.csv', mode='w', newline='') as csv\_file:

` `csv\_writer = csv.writer(csv\_file)

` `for row in data:

`  `csv\_writer.writerow(row)

**Explaination:** 

In this example, we create a list of lists called data which contains some sample data. We then open a new CSV file called 'new\_file.csv' using the open() function and write the contents of data to the CSV file using the csv.writer() function. We use a for loop to iterate through each row in data and write it to the CSV file using the csv\_writer.writerow() function.

# OBJECTS AND MAP IN PYTHON

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/234592568-575f7d44-4ebf-4c8b-a26e-a7f7cff3b7e4.png)


Description automatically generated](Aspose.Words.d8afd77f-df63-475f-bc94-ec1700bdbba8.009.png)

In Python, objects and maps are related to the concepts of classes and dictionaries, respectively.

**Objects:**

In Python, everything is an object. An object is an instance of a class, which defines a set of attributes and methods. To create an object, you first define a class, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects. 

**Example**:

**CODE**

**Print(Farheen)**

class Person:

`    `def \_\_init\_\_(self, name, age):

`        `self.name = name

`        `self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 25)

print(p1.name)

print(p1.age)

**Explaination:** 

In this example, we define a class called Person which has two attributes: name and age. We then create an object of the Person class called p1, passing in values for the name and age attributes. We can then access the values of the attributes using the dot notation (i.e., p1.name and p1.age).

# MAPS

In Python, maps are commonly implemented using dictionaries. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a value. 

**Example**:

**CODE**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

my\_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3"}

print(my\_dict["key2"])

**Explaination:** 

In this example, we define a dictionary called my\_dict which contains three key-value pairs. We can access the value associated with a specific key using the square bracket notation (i.e., my\_dict["key2"] returns the value "value2").

Note that dictionaries can also be created using the dict() constructor function, and can contain keys of different data types.

# LAMBDA AND LIST COMPREHENSIONS

Lambda functions and list comprehensions are two powerful features of Python that allow for concise and expressive **CODE**.

**Lambda Functions:**

Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are functions that are defined without a name. They are useful for defining small, one-time-use functions. 

**Example:**

**CODE**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

\# Define a lambda function that squares a number

square = lambda x: x\*\*2

\# Call the lambda function

result = square(5)

print(result)

**Explaination:** 

In this example, we define a lambda function called square that takes a single argument and returns the square of that argument. We can then call the lambda function like a regular function and pass in an argument (in this case, the number 5).

# LIST COMPREHENSIONS

List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python. They are essentially a compact for loop that performs some operation on each element in a sequence. 

**Example:**

**CODE**

**Print(FARHEEN)**
\# Create a list of the first 10 square numbers

squares = [x\*\*2 for x in range(1, 11)]

print(squares)

**Explaination:** In this example, we use a list comprehension to create a list called squares that contains the first 10 square numbers. The list comprehension consists of a for loop that iterates over the range 1 to 10, and an expression that squares each number in the range.

# NUMPY:

**ARRAY OPERATION**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/234592920-3ea5e2fd-4619-43d2-a988-cec8955b3d11.png)

NumPy arrays allow for fast and efficient operations on arrays, including mathematical operations, logical operations, and statistical operations. Here are some common array operations in NumPy:

**Mathematical Operations**: NumPy provides a large number of mathematical functions that can be applied to arrays, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and more. These functions can be applied to entire arrays or to individual elements.

**CODE**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

import numpy as np

**# Create two arrays**

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])

arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

**# Add the two arrays**

arr3 = arr1 + arr2

print(arr3)

**# Multiply the two arrays**

arr4 = arr1 \* arr2

print(arr4)

**Logical Operations:** NumPy provides logical operators such as and, or, and not that can be used to perform logical operations on arrays.

import numpy as np

**# Create an array**

arr = np.array([True, False, True])

\# Apply a logical operator to the array

result = np.logical\_not(arr)

print(result)

**Statistical Operations:** NumPy provides a large number of statistical functions that can be used to analyze arrays, including mean, median, standard deviation, variance, and more.

**CODE**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

import numpy as np

**# Create an array**

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

**# Calculate the mean of the array**

mean = np.mean(arr)

print(mean)

**# Calculate the standard deviation of the array**

std = np.std(arr)

print(std)

# INDEXING

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/234593031-76c5f9ca-20d5-40b4-96cd-fbb28f499fa0.png)

**Indexing:** Indexing is the process of accessing a specific element in a data structure by its position, or index, in the sequence. In Python, the first element in a sequence has an index of 0, and the last element has an index of -1. You can use square brackets [] to index a sequence in Python.

**CODE**

**# Indexing a list**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

my\_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(my\_list[0])   # Output: 1

print(my\_list[-1])  # Output: 5

**CODE**

**# Indexing a string**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

my\_string = "hello"

print(my\_string[1])   # Output: 'e'

print(my\_string[-1])  # Output: 'o'



# SLICING

**Slicing:** Slicing is the process of extracting a subset of elements from a data structure. In Python, you can slice a sequence using the syntax [start:stop:step], where start is the starting index, stop is the stopping index (exclusive), and step is the step size between each element.

**# Slicing a list**

**CODE**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

my\_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(my\_list[1:4])    # Output: [2, 3, 4]

print(my\_list[::2])    # Output: [1, 3, 5]

**# Slicing a string**

**CODE**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

my\_string = "hello"

print(my\_string[1:4])  # Output: 'ell'

print(my\_string[::2])  # Output: 'hlo'

# ITERATING

Iterating: Iterating is the process of looping over the elements in a data structure, one by one. In Python, you can use a for loop to iterate over a sequence.

**CODE**

**# Iterating over a list**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

my\_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for element in my\_list:

` `print(element)

**CODE**

**# Iterating over a string**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

my\_string = "hello"

for character in my\_string:

` `print(character)

**NOTE:** Indexing, slicing, and iterating are fundamental operations in Python and are used extensively in data analysis and scientific computing. NumPy arrays, for example, can also be indexed, sliced, and iterated over in similar ways to Python sequences.

# NUMPY WITH DATASET

NumPy can be used with datasets in a variety of ways. Here are a few examples:

**Loading Data Into NumPy Arrays:** You can use NumPy's loadtxt function to read data from a text file into a NumPy array. The function can handle different formats, such as comma-separated values (CSV) or tab-separated values (TSV), and can also skip header lines or handle missing data.

import numpy as np

data = np.loadtxt('data.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)

**Performing Operations On Arrays:** NumPy provides many functions for working with arrays, such as performing arithmetic operations, calculating statistical measures, and manipulating the shape of arrays. For example, you can calculate the mean and standard deviation of an array using the mean and std functions:

mean = np.mean(data)

std = np.std(data)

**Filtering & Selecting Data:** You can use NumPy arrays to filter and select data based on certain conditions. For example, you can select all rows where a certain column is greater than a certain value:

selected\_rows = data[data[:, 2] > 10]

**Visualizing Data:** NumPy arrays can also be used with other Python libraries for data visualization, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn. You can create plots and charts to explore patterns and trends in the data:

**CODE**

**Print(FARHEEN)**

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1])

plt.xlabel('X')

plt.ylabel('Y')

plt.show()

**NOTE:** These are just a few examples of how NumPy can be used with datasets. NumPy provides many more features and functions for working with arrays, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and scientific computing.

# API:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/240897596-815ca14a-7655-4429-88b7-c796c4368c18.png)

API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. Different software applications can communicate and interact with one another according to a set of rules and protocols. APIs specify the procedures, data structures, and guidelines that programmers must adhere to when connecting their applications with a certain piece of software or service.

Without having to comprehend the intricate implementation details, APIs allow developers to access and utilise the functionality of other software systems, such as web services, libraries, or operating systems. They give programmes a standardised way to ask for and exchange data, carry out actions, and use resources made available by the API provider.

In many diverse situations, including web development, mobile app development, cloud computing, and the integration of numerous software systems, APIs are frequently utilised. By building on top of current platforms and technologies, they enable developers to take use of existing services, expand the functionality of their apps, and generate novel solutions.

**API Working:**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/240897978-3fff117b-0d42-408f-93af-17d0c83a728a.png)

An API functions in a set of steps that enable communication and interaction between programmes. Here is a general explanation of how APIs operate:

**-Request:** The client application sends an HTTP request (such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE) to a particular URL or endpoint to start a request to the API. The request contains data in the request body occasionally, as well as headers and parameters.

**-Routing:** Based on the URL and HTTP method used, the API server receives the request and chooses the best endpoint and handler to handle it.
Processing: The requested endpoint's associated activities or business logic are carried out by the API server. This could entail using external services, conducting calculations, accessing databases, or any other necessary tasks.

**-Authentication and Authorization:** The server may authenticate the client to make sure it has the necessary permissions to access the requested resources, depending on the security needs of the API. Use of API keys, tokens, or other authentication methods may be required.

**-Data Retrieval or Manipulation:** Depending on the parameters of the request and the business logic, the API server retrieves or modifies the data. This can entail running a database query, handling files, or carrying out any other relevant operations.

**-Response:** After handling the request, the server creates an HTTP response. The answer normally consists of a response body containing the requested data or pertinent error messages, as well as a status code indicating whether the request was successful or unsuccessful.

**-Data Transfer:** Over the network, the server delivers the HTTP response back to the client application. The client application receives and processes the response.

**-Client-Side Processing:** After receiving the response, the client application processes it in accordance with its needs. This may entail analysing the response, showing the user the data, or taking additional actions in response to the information received.

 The use of APIs allows programmes to communicate with one another, share information, and take advantage of the functions offered by the API provider. The architecture of the API will determine the specifics and protocols used for communication, such as REST (Representational State Transfer), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), GraphQL, or others.

# DATA EXTRACTION FROM API THROUGH CODE?

You normally need to perform the following steps in order to extract data from an API using code:

**1. Select an API:** Choose the API from which you can extract the desired data. This could be an internal API you created or a public API offered by a platform or service.

**2. Obtain API Credentials.** You might need to acquire authentication credentials, such as an API key, access token, or username/password combination, depending on the API's specifications. Your queries to the API are authenticated using these credentials.

**3. Configure The API Client:** You must configure either an HTTP client library or a specialised API client library, depending on the programming language you're using. These tools make it easier to send HTTP requests and manage responses.

**4. Send HTTP Requests:** To send HTTP queries to the API's endpoints, use the API client library. Using the API documentation and the action you wish to do (such as accessing, creating, or changing data), choose the proper HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE). Include any relevant request body data, headers, and parameters.

**5. Handle The Response:** You can extract the data from the response body after receiving the response from the API. The information could be delivered in a number of formats, like JSON.

**Example Python Code For Data Extraction Through API** 
import requests

// API endpoint URL

url = "https://api.example.com/data"

//API request headers (if required)

headers = 
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

//Send GET request to the API

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

//Check if the request was successful (200 status code)

if response.status_code == 200:
    # Extract the response data in JSON format
    data = response.json()

    # Process and use the extracted data as needed
    for item in data:
        print(item)
else:
    # Request was not successful, print the error status code
    print("Error:", response.status_code)

**Explaination of The Code:**

Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step to understand what it does:

1. We import the requests library, enabling us to make HTTP queries to the API and manage their answers.

2. We use a string variable called url to represent the API endpoint URL. This need to be the URL that the API documentation provides for the particular data that you want to get.

3. To hold any necessary headers for the API request, we then build a dictionary called headers. For authentication purposes, we add a bearer token and a "Authorization" header in the example code. Depending on the type of authentication the API requires, you might need to change this.

4. To submit a GET request to the API endpoint, we employ the requests.get() method. The endpoint URL is specified by the url variable, and any necessary headers are passed via an argument in the form of the headers dictionary.

5. The response variable contains the API response that was received.

6. Using response.status_code, we examine the response's status code. We explicitly check in this case if it equals 200, which denotes a successful request. We extract and handle the data if the status code is 200.

7. Using the response.json() method, the response's content is retrieved and parsed as JSON. This implies that JSON data is returned by the API. You would need to modify the code if the API returned data in a different format.

8. We iterate over the extracted data using a for loop and print each item. This is just an example to demonstrate how to process the data. You would typically customize this part of the code based on your specific requirements.

9. If the status code is not 200, the code prints an error message along with the actual status code received.

# NOTE:

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to modify the code based on the specific requirements of the API you are working with, such as authentication, request parameters, error handling, and data processing. Refer to the API documentation for accurate implementation details.

In this illustration, a GET request is made using the requests library and sent to the API endpoint identified by the url variable. Any necessary headers, like an access token for authentication, are contained in the headers dictionary. Depending on the particular requirements of the API you are using, you might need to adjust the headers dictionary.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/241411196-fd5004b4-fab6-4878-9279-a0f38afc877c.png)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method for examining and summarising data sets in order to better understand their key features, find trends, spot abnormalities, and develop ideas for additional investigation. In order to explore the data and generate insights that might inform later data modelling and decision-making processes, it entails applying a variety of statistical and visual tools.

The following are some typical procedures and methods used in exploratory data analysis:

**1. Data Gathering & Initial inspection:** Compile the pertinent data and look over its dimensions, structure, and fundamental characteristics including the number of variables, data types, and missing values.

**2.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data during data cleaning and preprocessing. In this step, missing values may be imputed, outliers may be eliminated, and variable transformations may be necessary.

**3.Univariate Analysis:** Analyse each variable separately to comprehend its distribution, summary statistics (mean, median, and mode), range, and spot outliers using a univariate approach. The usage of methods like histograms, box plots, and summary statistics is widespread.

**4.Bivariate & Multivariate Aalysis:** Analyse the associations between variables using bivariate and multiple variables. Correlation analysis can be used with numerical variables to express the strength and direction of correlations. It is common to employ scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices. Contingency tables and bar plots can be used to investigate associations for categorical variables.

**5.Visualisation:** To exhibit the data and spot patterns, trends, and outliers, use a variety of visualisations such scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps. Making data-driven judgements and comprehending complex relationships can both benefit from visualisations.

**6.Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or altering existing ones using domain expertise and understanding derived from EDA. To enhance the performance of the model, this stage may involve generating derived features, scaling variables, or introducing interaction terms.

**7.Summary & Interpretation:** Condense the results of the EDA process, highlight significant trends or insights, and develop ideas for more research or modelling. In this step, the results are interpreted in light of the problem domain.

# NOTE:
As it aids in understanding the data, identifies potential problems, and directs further analysis or modelling tasks, EDA is a vital step in the data analysis pipeline. It enables data scientists and analysts to comprehend the data more thoroughly, spot problems with the quality of the data, and produce ideas for additional research.

# Types of Charts & Graphs

**UNIVARIATE:**

Univariate analysis in data science refers to the investigation and analysis of one variable in a dataset. Investigating and summarising the traits, trends, and distribution of that variable without reference to other variables in the dataset is required.

The initial investigation and comprehension of a dataset must include a process known as univariate analysis. It aids data scientists in understanding the many variables and locating significant traits, patterns, or outliers that might be important during the analysis or modelling phase.

In univariate analysis, it is common to compute summary statistics (such as mean, median, and standard deviation), visualise the data using histograms, box plots, or bar charts, and run hypothesis tests or significance checks to see if there are statistically significant differences between groups or categories.

For more complex data analysis methods, such as multivariate analysis, where correlations between several variables are examined, univariate analysis serves as a basis. Data scientists can better grasp the properties of variables by looking at them separately and then decide how to model and analyse the data in more detail.

# COUNT PLOT

A count plot is a sort of data science visualisation that shows the frequency with which each category appears in a categorical variable. The height of each bar on the bar graph shows the number or frequency of observations in each category.

Count plots are frequently used to investigate the frequency and distribution of categorical variables and to pinpoint the most frequent or uncommon categories. They give a brief summary of the data and can point out anomalies, imbalances, or patterns in the variable.

Count plots may be readily constructed in Python by utilising several data visualisation frameworks like Seaborn or Matplotlib. Using the Seaborn library as an example

**Python Code:**

import seaborn as sns

#Create a count plot
sns.countplot(x='category', data=data)

#Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Count Plot of Categories')

#Display the plot
plt.show()

**Explaination:**

In this example, the count plot is created using the countplot() function from Seaborn. The x parameter specifies the categorical variable to be plotted, and the data parameter specifies the dataset containing the variable. Additional customization can be done using functions from Matplotlib, such as adding labels and a title to the plot.

The resulting count plot visualizes the count or frequency of each category in the specified variable, providing insights into the distribution and occurrence of different categories.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/242266622-72fbff07-ac3a-4a6b-9990-b08624f43da5.png)


# HISTOGRAM:

A histogram plot, also referred to as a histogram chart, shows the distribution of a continuous quantity graphically. It indicates the frequency or count of observations falling into each bin after dividing the variable's range into bins or intervals.

Histograms are used to determine the central tendency and spread of the variable, visualise the form and structure of the data distribution, and spot any outliers or odd patterns.

By combining different data visualisation frameworks, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, you may make a histogram plot in Python. 

**Python Code:**

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Create a histogram plot
plt.hist(data, bins=10)

#Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Variable')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Histogram Plot')

#Display the plot
plt.show()

**Explaination:**

In this example, the hist() function from Matplotlib is used to create the histogram plot. The data parameter specifies the variable for which the histogram is created, and the bins parameter specifies the number of bins or intervals to divide the range of the variable.

You can customize the plot further by adjusting the number of bins, adding labels to the x-axis and y-axis, and providing a title for the plot. Histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of the variable, allowing you to understand the data's range, shape, and potential outliers.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/242266907-0e0951f9-99fa-490c-abea-5e5f7eb5e387.png)


# DIST PLOT:

A distribution plot, sometimes referred to as a density plot or a histogram plot with a fitted probability density function (PDF), combines a histogram with a smooth line to show the estimated probability density function of a continuous variable. It offers a visual picture of the data distribution's underlying structure.

With the help of different data visualisation packages like Seaborn or Matplotlib, you may make a distribution plot in Python. 

**Python Code:**

import seaborn as sns

#Create a distribution plot
sns.distplot(data)

#Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Variable')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.title('Distribution Plot')

#Display the plot
plt.show()

**Explaination:**

In this example, the distplot() function from Seaborn is used to create the distribution plot. The data parameter specifies the variable for which the distribution plot is created.

The variable's histogram is shown on the distribution plot along with a smoothed line that represents the estimated probability density function. It enables you to evaluate the distribution's form, central tendency, and dispersion visually. The distribution plot can also display other statistical data, such as the mean and standard deviation.

The x-axis and y-axis labels, a title, and other visualisation settings can all be changed to further personalise the plot. The distribution plot is a useful tool for data scientists to comprehend and visualise the distribution of continuous variables.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/242267098-eec84f70-536b-4775-8a62-a652250d8811.png)

# DIS PLOT:

For displaying distributions of univariate data, Seaborn's displot function is a versatile tool. It provides a thorough understanding of the distribution of the data by combining components of both a histogram and a kernel density plot.

**Python Code:**

import seaborn as sns

#Create a displot
sns.displot(data)

#Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Variable')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.title('Displot')

#Display the plot
plt.show()

**Explainatoin:**

In this example, the displot function is used to create the distribution plot. The data parameter represents the variable or data for which the distribution is to be plotted.

The resulting plot shows the distribution of the variable, together with a smoothed line representing the estimated probability density function and a representation resembling a histogram with bars. Customization options for the displot function include changing the number of bins, adding labels and a title, and including additional visualisation components.

Please be aware that depending on the Seaborn library version you are using, some functions may not be accessible or usable. For the most recent information, it's always a good idea to consult the official Seaborn documentation.

# BOX PLOT:

A box plot, also referred to as a box-and-whisker plot, shows the distribution of a continuous variable through quartiles graphically. The minimum, median, third quartile, and maximum values of the data are shown, along with the first quartile's (25th percentile), median's (50th percentile), and maximum values.

Two whiskers extend from a rectangular box that makes up a box plot. The range between the first and third quartiles is represented by the box, which is known as the interquartile range (IQR). The median is shown by the line inside the box. The whiskers go all the way out to the minimum and maximum values in a range or to particular quantiles.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/242267432-a71652cf-5b0e-4d1e-8c33-c7e005bf74fd.png)

Box plots are helpful for comparing distributions between groups or categories, finding outliers, and visualising the dispersion and skewness of data. They give a succinct overview of the data distribution and draw attention to any differences or abnormalities.

Using several data visualisation packages like Seaborn or Matplotlib, you may make a box plot in Python.

**BOX PLOT WISKERS & WORKING:**

In a box plot, the whiskers represent the variability or spread of the data beyond the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is a measure of the dispersion of the central 50% of the data. The whiskers extend from the box in a box plot and typically indicate the minimum and maximum values within a certain range or to specific quantiles.

The exact calculation and representation of the whiskers in a box plot can vary depending on the method used. There are generally two common methods for determining the length of the whiskers:

**1. Tukey's Fences Method:** In this method, the whiskers extend up to a certain distance from the upper and lower quartiles. The whiskers are typically set to 1.5 times the IQR. Data points beyond this range are considered outliers and are plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers.

**2. Tukey's Boxplot Method**: This method is similar to Tukey's fences but sets the whiskers to the most extreme data points within a certain range. The whiskers extend to the largest and smallest data points within 1.5 times the IQR. Data points beyond this range are considered outliers.

The whiskers in a box plot help visualize the range of the data and identify potential outliers. Outliers are data points that fall outside the whiskers and may indicate unusual or extreme values compared to the rest of the data. Outliers can be valuable for detecting anomalies, understanding data quality issues, or assessing the distribution's tails.

It's worth noting that the specific calculation and representation of whiskers may vary depending on the software or library used for creating the box plot. Some variations include adjusting the whisker length, using different methods for determining outliers, or employing alternative techniques such as whiskers that extend to a fixed percentage of the data range.

Overall, the whiskers in a box plot provide a visual representation of the spread and outliers in the data, allowing for a quick understanding of the data's variability and distributional characteristics.


**Python Code:**

import seaborn as sns

#Create a box plot
sns.boxplot(x='category', y='variable', data=data)

#Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Variable')
plt.title('Box Plot')

#Display the plot
plt.show()

**Explaination:**

The boxplot() function from Seaborn is used to create the box plot. The x parameter specifies the categorical variable to be plotted on the x-axis, the y parameter specifies the continuous variable to be plotted on the y-axis, and the data parameter specifies the dataset containing the variables.

The x-axis and y-axis labels, a title, and other visualisation settings can all be changed to further personalise the plot. Box plots make fast comparisons of distributions possible and reveal information about the data's skewness, spread, and central tendency.

# BAR PLOT:

Rectangular bars are used to depict categorical data in a bar plot, sometimes referred to as a bar chart or bar graph. The height of each bar, which represents a category, reflects the value or frequency of that category.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/242267698-6217af1c-1033-41b6-b256-c048872cc5c8.png)


For comparing the values or frequencies of several categories, seeing patterns, and showcasing trends or relationships, bar charts are very helpful. They are useful for both qualitative and quantitative analyses and are effective at communicating discrete facts.

Using several data visualisation frameworks like Matplotlib or Seaborn, you can make a bar plot in Python. 

**Python Code:**

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Create a bar plot
plt.bar(categories, values)

#Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Bar Plot')

#Display the plot
plt.show()

**Explaination:**

In this example, the bar() function from Matplotlib is used to create the bar plot. The categories variable represents the categories or labels for the x-axis, and the values variable represents the corresponding values or frequencies for the y-axis.

The colour of the bars, labels for the x- and y-axes, a title, and other visualisation characteristics can all be changed to further personalise the plot.

In data analysis and reporting, bar charts are frequently used to present categorical data and visually compare several categories. They make it simple to grasp and interpret the relationships or differences between categories and offer a clear and natural manner to express discrete data.

# PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION (PDF):

The probability density function (PDF) is a key tool in data science for comprehending and simulating the distribution of continuous random variables. It is very helpful for doing statistical inference, data interpretation, and analysis.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/242267867-8079f606-e60a-4d29-ac9f-6b3644c6e846.png)

The PDF is used in data science in numerous ways, including:

**1. Descriptive Analysis:**

The PDF gives data scientists understanding of the shape, central tendency, and variability of a variable's distribution. With this knowledge, you can spot trends, outliers, and anomalies in the data.

**2. Probability Estimation:**

Data scientists can calculate the likelihood that a random variable will fall inside a given range by integrating the PDF over that range. Making predictions and determining the likelihood of particular outcomes benefit from this information.

**3. Modelling & Simulation:** Parametric models are frequently used by data scientists to represent data distributions. In creating these models and calculating their parameters, the PDF is crucial. It is feasible to create synthetic data and simulate various scenarios by fitting a PDF to observed data.

**4. In hypothesis testing**, the likelihood ratios and p-values are computed using the PDF. The likelihoods under various hypotheses can be compared in order to derive statistical inferences and conclusions about the data.

**5. Machine Learning:** The PDF is a vital part of many machine learning algorithms that are used to calculate likelihoods and make predictions. For instance, the PDF of each feature is used to calculate the likelihood of a specific class label in Gaussian Naive Bayes classification.

For understanding, modelling, and analysing the distribution of continuous random variables, the PDF is an essential tool in data science. Data scientists can use it to gather knowledge, anticipate the future, and make statistical inferences.

# BIVARIATE:

Bivariate analysis is an approach in data science and statistics that involves the analysis of the relationship between two variables. It focuses on understanding how two variables are related to each other and how changes in one variable are associated with changes in the other variable.

Bivariate analysis explores the joint distribution of two variables and aims to uncover patterns, associations, dependencies, or correlations between them. It helps in identifying the nature and strength of the relationship, as well as any potential trends or patterns that may exist.

Common techniques used in bivariate analysis include scatter plots, correlation analysis, contingency tables, and regression analysis. These techniques allow for visualizing the relationship between the variables, calculating correlation coefficients or regression coefficients, and testing for statistical significance.

Bivariate analysis can provide valuable insights into the relationship between two variables and help answer questions such as:

* Is there a positive or negative relationship between the variables?
* Is the relationship linear or non-linear?
* Are there any outliers or influential points in the relationship?
* What is the strength and direction of the relationship?
* Can one variable be predicted or explained by the other variable?

By examining the relationship between two variables, bivariate analysis enhances the understanding of how changes in one variable may affect the other variable. It is a fundamental step in exploring data and building predictive models that involve multiple variables.


# PAIR PLOT:

A pair plot, also known as a scatter plot matrix, is a graphical tool used to visualize the pairwise relationships between multiple variables in a dataset. It displays scatter plots for each possible combination of variables, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of their associations and dependencies.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/243709271-23f4c85d-bcce-4513-a97c-3e9eb8a980b9.png)


A pair plot is particularly useful when working with datasets containing multiple numerical variables. It helps in understanding how variables are related to each other and provides insights into potential patterns, correlations, or trends.

In Python, the seaborn library provides a convenient function called `pairplot()` for creating pair plots.

**PYTHON CODE:**

import seaborn as sns

#Create a pair plot
sns.pairplot(data)

#Display the plot

plt.show()


**EXPLAINATION OF THE CODE:**

The `pairplot()` function from seaborn is used to create the pair plot. The `data` parameter represents the dataset containing the variables of interest.

The resulting pair plot consists of a grid of scatter plots, where each cell displays the relationship between two variables. The diagonal cells typically show the distribution of each variable, while the off-diagonal cells show the scatter plots illustrating the relationship between the corresponding variables.

Pair plots provide a quick visual summary of the relationships between variables, making it easy to identify any linear or nonlinear associations, outliers, clusters, or patterns in the data. They are particularly useful for exploratory data analysis and can help guide further analysis, feature selection, or modeling decisions.

Additionally, pair plots can incorporate additional visual elements such as color-coding based on a categorical variable or adding regression lines or density estimates to the scatter plots, enhancing the information conveyed by the plot.

Overall, pair plots offer a powerful and intuitive way to visualize the relationships between multiple variables in a dataset, facilitating data exploration and hypothesis generation in data science and statistical analysis.

# PANDAS PROFILER:

Pandas profilers are tools or libraries that provide detailed analysis and insights into a pandas DataFrame or Series. These profilers automate the process of data exploration, quality assessment, and feature engineering by generating comprehensive reports with statistical summaries, visualizations, and actionable recommendations.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95965896/243709780-19002863-039b-45c7-88c8-b139de8499b6.png)

Some popular pandas profilers include:

**1. Pandas-Profiling:** pandas-profiling is a widely used open-source library that generates detailed HTML reports for a DataFrame. It provides a summary of the dataset's structure, statistical analysis, missing values, correlation matrix, variable distributions, and much more. It offers valuable insights and saves time in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase.

It's worth noting that pandas profilers may have slightly different features and capabilities, so it's recommended to explore and compare them to find the one that best fits your specific requirements and preferences.

# PANDAS IDIOMS:

Pandas idioms refer to the common or recommended patterns and techniques used in pandas for efficient and effective data manipulation, analysis, and transformation. These idioms aim to simplify code, improve performance, and enhance the readability and maintainability of pandas code.

Here are some pandas idioms that are widely used:

**1. Chaining Methods:** Pandas allows method chaining, which means applying multiple operations in a sequence using dot notation. This helps to write concise and readable code. For example:

   ```python
   df_cleaned = df.dropna().set_index('Date').sort_values('Value')
   ```

**2. Vectorized Operations:** Pandas is designed to work efficiently with vectorized operations, which perform computations on entire arrays of data. This avoids explicit looping and improves performance. For example, instead of using a loop to apply a function to each element, you can use vectorized functions like `apply()`, `map()`, or mathematical operations directly on pandas Series or DataFrames.

**3. Boolean Indexing:** Pandas supports boolean indexing, which allows filtering and selecting data based on conditions. This is done by passing a boolean Series or DataFrame to the indexing operator (`[]`). 

**For Example:**

   python
   df_filtered = df[df['Value'] > 0]
  

**4. Grouping and Aggregation:** Pandas provides powerful grouping and aggregation functions for summarizing data. The `groupby()` function is used to group data based on one or more columns, and then various aggregation functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, `count()`, etc., can be applied to calculate summary statistics.

**5. Reshaping Data:** Pandas provides functions for reshaping data, such as `melt()`, `pivot()`, `stack()`, `unstack()`, `pivot_table()`, etc. These functions help in transforming data between wide and long formats or performing operations like pivoting, stacking, and unstacking.

**6. Method Parameters:** Pandas methods often have useful parameters that can be leveraged to optimize performance or handle specific data scenarios. For example, `inplace=True` can be used to modify a DataFrame in place, avoiding unnecessary data copies.

These are just a few examples of pandas idioms that can help in writing efficient and effective code for data manipulation and analysis. It's recommended to explore the pandas documentation, tutorials, and examples to learn more about these idioms and best practices for working with pandas.

# MULTI-VARIATE:

Multivariate analysis is an approach in data science and statistics that involves the simultaneous analysis of three or more variables. It focuses on understanding the relationships, patterns, and relationships among multiple variables in a dataset.

Multivariate analysis goes beyond bivariate analysis by considering the joint distribution of multiple variables together. It allows for a comprehensive examination of the interdependencies and complex relationships between multiple variables, rather than studying them individually.

Some common techniques used in multivariate analysis include multivariate regression, principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis, cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling. These techniques enable data scientists to explore the relationships between variables, identify underlying dimensions or factors, group similar observations, and reduce the dimensionality of the data.

Multivariate analysis can provide insights into various aspects, such as:

* Dependency and association between multiple variables.
* Identification of underlying patterns, structures, or dimensions in the data.
* Prediction and modeling of multiple dependent variables.
* Grouping or clustering of observations based on multiple variables.
* Visualization of high-dimensional data.

By considering multiple variables simultaneously, multivariate analysis allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex datasets. It helps in uncovering hidden relationships and patterns that may not be apparent in univariate or bivariate analysis alone, and enables data scientists to make more informed decisions, predictions, and inferences.
